## Background

The chief Executive of each state can nominate tracts as QOZs in their state. A tract will be eligible if it meets the requirements of a "low-income community" or if it is both: (a) adjacent to an LIC and (b) has a median household income of less than 1.25 times the income of the adjacent LIC. 

Up to one-quarter of the LIC census tracts in a state may be designated as QOZs, or up to 25 QOZs if the state has less than 100 LIC tracts. Up to five percent of tracts in a state may be designated as non-LIC or LIC-adjacent tracts (with fractional portions rounded up). A QOZ designation may be based on either 2011-2015 5-year ACS data or a more recent 5-year survey with appropriate justification.
